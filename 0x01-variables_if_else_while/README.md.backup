## Notes
### Keywords and Identifiers
#### Keywords
C keeps a small set of keywords for its own use. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers in the program. Here is the list of keywords used in Standard C; you will notice that none of them use upper-case letters.

| auto     | double | int      | struct   |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| break    | else   | long     | switch   |
| case     | enum   | register | typedef  |
| char     | extern | return   | union    |
| const    | float  | short    | unsigned |
| continue | for    | signed   | void     |
| default  | goto   | sizeof   | volatile |
| do       | if     | static   | while    |

#### Identifiers

Identifier is the fancy term used to mean ‘name’.The rules for the construction of identifiers are simple: you may use the 52 upper and lower case alphabetic characters, the 10 digits and finally the underscore ‘_’, which is considered to be an alphabetic character for this purpose. The only restriction is the usual one; identifiers must start with an alphabetic character.

The new limit on length of identifiers is 31 characters—although identifiers may be longer, they must differ in the first 31 characters if you want to be sure that your programs are portable. 

External identifiers are the ones that have to be visible outside the current source code file. Typical examples of these would be library routines or functions which have to be called from several different source files.

External identifiers should differ from each other in the first six characters. Worse than that, upper and lower case letters in external identifiers  may be treated the same!

## TASKS
### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable ´n´ each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

- The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program.
- You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code.
- The output of the program should be:
  - The number, followed by
    - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    - if the number is 0: `is zero`
    - if the number is less than 0: `is negative` 
  - followed by a new line.
 Task Code:
 ```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

/**
  *main - Entry point
  *
  *Return: Always 0 (Success)
  *
  */
int main(void)
{
	int n;

	srand(time(0));
	n = rand() - RAND_MAX / 2;
	if (n ==  0)
	{
		printf("is zero\n");
	}
	else if (n > 0)
	{
		printf("is positive\n");
	}
	else
	{
		printf("is negative\n");
	}
	return (0);
}
 ```
 
### 1. The last digit
This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program
- You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code.
- The output of the program should be:
  - The string Last digit of, followed by `n`, followed by:
    - the string `is`, followed by
    - if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
    - if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
     if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line
