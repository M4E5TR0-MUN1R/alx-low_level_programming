C (pronounced /ˈsiː/ – like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by __Dennis Ritchie__, and remains very widely used and influential. <br>
By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.<br> 
It has found lasting use in:
- operating systems 
- device drivers
- protocol stacks 

And though it is being decreasingly used for application software, C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems!
